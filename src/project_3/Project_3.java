// Write a program that creates a two-dimensional array intialized with test daa. 
//  Use any primtive data type that you wish.  The program should have the following methods.

//  getTotal.  This method should accept a two-dimensional array as its argument and return the total of
// all the values in the array.  

// getAverage.  This method should accept a two-dimensional array as its argument and return the average 
//  of all the values in the array.

//  getRowTotal.  This mehtod should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second 
// argument.  The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array.  The method should return
//  the totla of the values in the specified row.

//  getColumnTotal.   This method should accept a two-dimensional array as its frist argument and an integer as its second 
//  argument.  The second argument should be the subscript of a column in the array.  The method should 
//  return the total of ht evalues in the specified column.

//  getHighestInRow.  This method should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer
//  as its second argument.  The second argument should be a subscript of a row in the array.  The method
//  should return the highest value in the specified row of the array.

//  getLowestInRow.  This mehtod should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer
//  as its second second argument.  the second argument should be a subscript of a row in the array.  The method
//  should return the lowest value in the specified row of the array.

//  Demonstrate the methods somehow.
